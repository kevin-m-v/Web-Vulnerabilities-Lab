# Web-Vulnerabilities-Lab
Welcome to my cybersecurity lab, where I built a website from scratch to hack into it! My goal for this project was to gain insight into common vulnerabilities by seeing things from the perspectives of both the hacker and the developer. The tech stack used here: HTML/CSS for the front-end, JavaScript with Node.js/Express.js for the middleware and back-end code, and MySQL for the database. In this write-up, I'll cover SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting attacks, coupled with video demonstrations.
**Disclaimer**: The techniques shown here were done on a local instance of my website for educational purposes only. Using these hacking techniques on a live website without expressed written consent from the owner/admin is ILLEGAL.

# SQL Injection
An SQL Injection(SQLi) attack occurs when a threat actor can manipulate SQL queries through vulnerable user input fields on a website. This can give the threat actor access to sensitive information or even allow them to escalate their privileges.
